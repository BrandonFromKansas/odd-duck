# odd-duck
* I collaborated on this lab with Demarquies Jolley.

This project was about rendering three different odd-duck products per turn. The user can then click to vote on which product they prefer. Once a total of 25 votes have been cast, a bar graph will display showing the number of times each product was viewed as well as how many times it was been voted on. This application uses local storage so that the views and votes for each product continues adding up even if the browser is reloaded.
